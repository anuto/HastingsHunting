Two Tuppenny Ones, Please.
By Katherine Mansield.
LADY : Yes, there is, dear; there’s plenty of room. If
the lady next to me would move her seat and sit
opposite. . . . Would you mind? So that my
friend may sit next to me. . . . Thank you so
much ! Yes, dear, both the cars are on war work ;
I’m getting quite used to ‘buses. Of course if
we go to the theatre, I ’phone Cynthia. She’s
still got one car. Her chauffeur’s been called up.
. . . Ages ago. . . . Killed by now, I think. I can’t
quite remember. I don’t like her new man at all.
I don’t mind taking any reasonable risk, but he’s
so obstinate-lie charges everything he sees.
Heaven alone knows what would happen if he
rushed into something that wouldn’t swerve aside.
But the poor creature’s got a withered arm, and
something the matter with one of his feet, I believe
she told me. I suppose that’s what makes him so
careless. I mean-well ! . . . Don’t you know ! . .
FRIEND:. . . ?
LADY: Yes, she’s sold it. My dear, it was far too
small. There were only ten bedrooms, you know.
There were only ten bedrooms in that house. Extraordinary!
One wouldn’t believe it from the
outside-would one? And with the governesses
and the nurses-?nd so on. All the men servants
had to sleep out. . . . You know what that means.

FRIEND:. . . !!
CONDUCTOR ; Fares please
LADY : How much ’is it Tuppence, isn’t it? Two
tuppenny ones, pleas-.. Don’t bother-I’ve got
some coppers, somewhere or other.
Pass your fares along.
FRIEND: . . . !
LADY : No, it’s all right.
CONDUCTOR : Parse your fares, please.
FRIEND:. . . !
LADY : Really? So I did. I remember now Yes, I
paid coming‘. Very well; I’ll let you, just this once.
War time, my dear !
I’ve got some-if only I can
find them.
CONDUCTOR: ’Ow far do you want ter go?
LADY : ’To the Boltons.
CONDUCTOR : Another ’appeny each.
LADY : No-oh, no ! I only paid tuppence coming. Are
you quite sure?
CONDUCTO(Rs avagely) : Read it on the board for yourself
.
LADY: Oh, very well Here’s another ‘penny. To
friend) : Isn’t it extraordinary how disobliging
these men are. After all, he’s paid to do his job. But
they are nearly all alike. I’ve heard these motor
’buia affect the spine after a time. I suppose
that’s it. . . . You’ve heard about Teddie-haven’t
you ?
FRIEND: . . .
LADY: He’s got his. . . He’s got his . . . Now what
is it! Whatever can it be. How ridiculolus of
me !
FRIEND:. . . ?
LADY : Oh, no ! He’s been a Major for ages.
FRIEND: . . . ?
LADY: Colonel?. Oh, no, ,my dear, it’s something
much higher than that. Not his company-he’s
had his company a long time. Not his battalion. . .
FRIEND: . . . .
Lady Regiment! Yes, I believe it is his regiment.
But what I was going to say is he’s been made a
, . . Oh, how silly I am! What’s higher than a
Brigadier-General? Yes, I believe that’s it. Chief
of Staff. Of course, Mrs. T.’s frightfully gratified
FRIEND:. . . !
LADY : Hasn’t he ! He’s been most lucky-most mercifully
spared . . . so far. But he’s back again, you
know, and “over the top” every day.
FRIEND : . . .
LADY : Oh, my dear, everybody goes over the top nowadays
Whatever his position may be. And
Teddy is such a sport, I really don’t see how. . . .
Too dreadful-isn’t it !
FRIEND: . . . ?
LADY: Didn’t you know? She’s at the War Office,
and doing very well. I believe she got a rise the
other day. She’s something to do with notifying
the deaths, or finding the missing. I don’t know
exactly what it is. At any rate, she says it is too
depressing for words, and she has to read the
most heart-rending . letters from parents; and so
on. Happily, they’re a very cheery little group in
’her room-all officers’ wives, and they make their
own tea, and get cakes in turn from Stewart’s.
She has one afternoon a week off, when she shops
or has her hair waved Last time she and I went
to see Yvette’s Spring Show.
FRIEND:. . . ?
LADY : No not really. I’m getting frightfully sick of
these coat-frocks-aren’t you I mean, as I was
saying to her, what is the use of paying an enormous
price for having one made by Yvette, when
you really can’t tell the difference in the long run,
between it and one of those cheap ready-made ones.
Of course one has the satisfaction for oneself of
knowing that the material is good, and so on-but
it looks nothing. No; I advised her to get a good
coat and skirt. For, after all, a good coat and
skirt always tells. Doesn’t it?
FRIEND:. . . !
LADY: Yes, I didn’t tell her that-but that’s what I
had in mind. She’s much too fat for those coatfrocks.
She goes out far too much at the hips. I
half ordered a rather lovely indefinite blue one for
myself, trimmed with the new lobster red. . . .
I’ve lost my good Kate, you know.
FRIEND:. . .
LADY: Yes, isn’t it annoying Just when I gat her
more or less trained Bat she went off her head,
like they all do nowadays, and decided that she
wanted to go into munitions. I told her when she
gave notice that she would go on the strict
understandingth at if she got a job (which I think is
highly improbable), she was not to come back and
disturb the other servants.
CONDUCTOR(s avagely) : Another penny each if you’re
going on.
LADY : Oh, we’re there. How extraordinary ! I never
should have noticed. . . .
FRIEND : . . . ?
LADY : Tuesday? Bridge on Tuesday? No, dear,
I’m afraid I can’t manage Tuesday. I trot out the
wounded every Tuesday, you know I let cook
take them to the Zoo, or some place like thatdon’t
you know Wednesday--I’m perfectly free
on Wednesday
CONDUCTOR: It’ll be Wednesday before you get off the
’bus if you don’t ’urry up.
LADY: That’s quite enough, my man.
FRIEND: . . . ? !
